# Check Point Passive DNS Learning Feeder
Within Check Point one can use Domain Objects to build firewall rules based on FQDNs. For this to work, the Check Point security gateway needs a working DNS server. Check Point also uses something they call 'Passive DNS Learning' to build an internal table to match FQDN's to IP addresses. For Passive DNS Learning to work, DNS queries from client to server needs to traverse the Check Point security gateway. 

There are environments where DNS queries from client to server, will not pass a Check Point security gateway on which one would like to use firewall rules based on Domain Objects. In such circumstances this iRule can be used together with Infoblox. To make this work one will have to turn on DNS Response logging on Infoblox and configure an external syslog server. This syslog server should point to the F5 virtual server, that listens to UDP/514 (syslog) and has the Check Point Passive DNS Learning iRule attached. Make sure the resolver, that is used by this iRule points to a DNS-server that will pass the Check Point security gateway on which you want to use Domain Objects.
